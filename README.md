## Project Info
This project is a web application built with Next.js that allows users to explore and discover captivating images and information from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API. APOD provides a new astronomy-related image or photograph every day, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer.

It retrieves information directly from the NASA APOD API, automatically refreshing data daily. Additionally, it features a responsive web design.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and deployed on Vercel. 

Deployed Project on Vercel: [Next.js NASA Photo of the Day](https://next-js-nasa-photo-of-the-day-maribelcuales.vercel.app/)

## Features 
Daily Image Display: The application fetches the latest APOD image and displays it on the homepage, providing users with a daily dose of stunning space visuals.

Date Selection: Users can explore APOD images from any date by selecting a specific date from the date picker. This feature allows users to revisit or discover images from the past.

Image Details: Clicking on an image reveals detailed information about it, including the title, date, explanation, and other relevant details. Users can delve into the scientific context behind each image.

Mobile Responsive: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Technologies Used
Next.js: The project is built on the Next.js framework, providing a fast and efficient development experience with server-side rendering.

React: The user interface is developed using React, enabling a component-based architecture for a modular and maintainable codebase.

NASA APOD API: The application fetches data from NASA's APOD API to dynamically retrieve the latest images and information.

Axios: To handle HTTP requests and efficiently interact with the APOD API.
